      <h1>Calculus AB</h1>
      <h2>It's not that hard.</h2>
      <br>
      <p id = "overview">While calculus may seem daunting, it really isn't.</p>
      <p>Calculus can be split into two huge catagories: Derivitives and Integrals</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id = "derivitive">Derivitives</h2>
      <p>The point of derivitives (at least for me) is to find the slope of an equation.</p>
      <p>While you could use the slope equation for simple lines, how are you suppose to get
        the slope of an equation like: y = cos(x)/sin(x)?</p>
      <p>Well obviously you use calculus or else I'd cut this part out.</p>
      <p>As for other functions that have multiple parts that have different equations, then
        you have to break it down and derive all of them.</p>
