      <h1>Calculus AB</h1>
      <h2>It's not that hard.</h2>
      <p>Hey acutally before you further, I'm not a teacher so I'm going to leave a lot of stuff out that would probably make your time in AB Calculus a whole lot easier. Just saying...</p>
      <br>
      <p id = "overview">While calculus may seem daunting, it really isn't.</p>
      <p>Calculus can be split into two huge catagories: Derivitives and Integrals</p>
      <p>According to a friend of mine, calculus is one world, "SLOPE".</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id = "derivitive">Derivitives</h2>
      <p>The point of derivitives (at least for me) is to find the slope of an equation.</p>
      <p>While you could use the slope equation for simple lines, how are you suppose to get
        the slope of an equation like: y = cos(x)/sin(x)?</p>
      <p>Well obviously you use calculus or else I'd cut this part out.</p>
      <p>As for other functions that have multiple parts that have different equations, then
        you have to break it down and derive all of them.</p>
      <p>But I'm getting lazy so I'll just explain everything here now.</p>
      <h2 id = "IntroDerivitive">LET'S GET STARTED SHALL WE?</h2>
      <p>Imagine a really amazing function, y = x. The slope is one right? Well yes, because the slope is constant.</p>
      <p>Now imaging another really iconic function, y = x<sup>2</sup>. This slope is constantly either increasing or decreasing, until the point of inflection.</p>
      <p>Don't know what a point of inflection is? Don't worry, that's for later.</p>
      <p>As I previously stated, Derivitives are all about getting the slope of a specific part of any funciton and there are some basic rules to learn.</p>
      <h2 id = "TheRules">The Power Rule</h2>
      <p>It honestly is way lamer than it sounds, but you basically look at a function like y = x<sup>4</sup>. And do this to it.</p>
      <h3> dy/dx = 4x<sup>3</sup></h3>
      <p>Do you see what I did? Hopefully you do because typing without a wrist rest sucks so I'm going on.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now look at a function like y = x<sup>1/2</sup>. This obviously is a square root function, and you apply the POWER RULE.</p>
      <p>Just watch and learn about how stupid this thing is.</p>
      <h3>dy/dx = -1/2x<sup>1/2</sup></h3>
      <p>Do you have no idea what happened? Good, because that's what's suppose to happen.</p>
      <p>Let's break this down shall we?</p>
      <p>First, get a piece of notebook paper out because this stuff is intense.</p>
      <p>Okay, so first you can multiply the function y by the power, which is 1/2 in this case.</p>
      <p>Second, you subtract one from the exponent, which makes -1/2.</p>
      <p>Since a negative exponent does this: 1/x, you can now hopefully figure out how I got that answer</p>
      <p>If you didn't then just ask somebody else because I don't have a degree in education...</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id = "multichez">Addition, Multiplying, & Dividing</h2>
      <p>Now for other more complicated equations like y = x<sup>2</sup>5x</p>
      <p>I'm just going to show the answer right below so you can try to guess what happened</p>
      <h3> dy/dx = 5x<sup>2</sup> + 10x<sup></h3>
      <p>Before you people say anything, just know that this is an example and if you noticed that the equation can be rewritten to y = 5x<sup>3</sup>, then good for you.</p>
      <p>The point of this is to show you how to derive multiplying equations, if you actually want to know why, then you should watch 3blue1brown becuse he does it better.</p>
      <p>But you're here anyways, so I'll just give you a pneumonic so you can remember how to derive it.</p>
      <h3> left d-right, right d-left </h3>
      <p>You just get the left side of the equation, and multiply it by the derivitive of the right side, and the same concept applies to the other side.</p>
      <p>Looking at the equation again, you should know be able to see how I got the answer, and using the power rule and some re-writting can show that this is the right answer.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id = "divichez">Deriving Dividing Functions</h2>
      <p>Awkward title aside, basically, when you're given a function like y = x<sup>5</sup>/x<sup>2</sup>, you should be able to derive it to this</p>
      <h3>5x<sup>6</sup> * 2x<sup>6</sup>/
