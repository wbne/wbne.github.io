A crucial component to quantum mechanics is the idea that any particle is both a wave and a particle at the same time.
	What does that mean?
It means that the "particle" eg. electrons, protons, photons, etc. can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
	Okay, but what does that like "really" mean?
Basically, sometimes we pretend that hadrons like a neutron acts like a solid "ball" almost
	This neutron would be expected to behave similarily to a soccer ball in Newtonian or Classical Mechanics.
Other times, we pretend that the same neutron acts more like a harmonic wave
	Although the famous double slit experiment was demonstrated with photons, it can be recreated with more complex particles such as neutrons, protons, and bucky balls (60 carbon atoms that form a ball)
	The pattern that forms from double slits can be imagined like two waves experiencing both constructive and destructive interference.
	Interference occurs as a result of the two slits and the wave-like nature of the particles passing through.
		You can think of two ripples on a pond and how they seem to cancel out or magnify in strength.

Another critical key to quantum mechanics is Planck's Constant (It's a lambda but I can't type that in vim)
	The constant is important because it is absolute regardless of the form we wish to observe the particle in
	Planck's Constant shows up as a result of the Compton Effect:
		This was an experiment that demonstrated that a photon transferring momentum to a stationary electron will cause the photon to exhibit a lower frequency as a result of the conservation of momentum. (eg. an x-ray becomes a ultra-violet ray after colliding)
		The loss of energy is also how Thompson discovered electrons because the experiment had some electrons bouncing off a crystal lattice that would lower the electron's energy enough to be reflected back or something.
	From this, the de Broglie Equation was formed which states that the wavelength is equal to Planck's Constant divided by the momentum.

Sometimes if you don't like yourself, you can describe the energy of a particle with respect to its momentum and some constants.
	(epsilon)^2 = m^2.c^2 + p^2.c^2
	Where epsilon is the energy of the particle, m is mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and p is momentum
Also if you really want to know the wavelength of an electron, then here:
	(3/2E)^.5 nm

It should be noted that the word "particle" is me being lazy and not calling it a "quantum particle" because a quantum particle has the idea of particle duality (both wave and particle properties) associated with it.

Atoms are covered more in the first chapter than I would like...
Although it's well known that electrons have energy levels within their shells, I had the joy of reading about how to calculate it.
	En = -(13.6/n^2) eV
	Where n is the principle quantum number based on the atom itself.
	Fun fact: if n^2 is greater than 13.6 then you get electrons yeeting themselves from the atom.
When the electrons go up or down an energy level, then they release energy in the form of light which is calculated with this:
	h.c/lambda = |Eni - Efi|
	Where h is Planck's Constant, lambda is wavelength, ni is initial energy level and fi is the final energy level.
It also turns out that atoms are really stubborn.
	You can think of them as really high quality rubber bands that clap back as hard as you stretch them.
	That's why they keep returning to the status quo for like everything except nuclear fission of fusion.
	Regardless of most things, an atoms properties are really determined by its proton count.
	They are also more condensed than Puppy Linux.
		Mercury is only 3 times larger than Hydrogen volume-wise.
Because of how stable an atom usually is, it's hard for an atom to have orbiting electrons as it would be really easy to have electrons flinging everywhere because of a stiff breeze.
	This means that the electrons on atoms are viewed more as a wave than a particle.
Assuming that the electrons are the furthest point of an atom, than de Broglie's equation can be used to determine the wavelength of the electrons zooming around the "surface" of the atom.
	However, since there are usually more than one electron, then the scale and quantity of the electrons makes it hard to track individual electrons due to entanglement or something.
	Also because all electrons are seen as waves, then they overlay in a Fourier Transform kinda way and form the unique "fingerprint" of the atom which gives it lots of more interesting properties like the Iodine-Amylose interaction.
	Another fun fact is that electrons, protons, and neutrons are all fermions which means they have to follow the Paulli Exclusion Principle which states that no two same particles can have the same quantum state so no no-clipping anytime soon.
		This doesn't include light because it carries a force, a characteristic defining of bosons, another particle catagory.
Apparently some guy found out that the inital energy state of an electron is:
	e^2/4pi.e0
	Where e = magnitude of the charge of both the proton and electron.
From this Bohr calculated the fundamental atomic radius of a hydrogen atom which is now called the Bohr Radius or something...
	a0 = ((4pi(e0)/e^2).h^2/(4pi^2.me) = .529 . 10^-10 meters.
With this amazing equation, Rydberg decided that he might as well determine the fundamental unit of binding energies for atoms.
	ER = e^2/(8pi.e0.a0) = 13.6 eV
	It also turns out that the fundamental binding energy for an atom with n is: ER / n^2
		So that's where the 13.6 eV appears in the energy levels in shells

I'm not going to try to talk about the experiments set up to help demonstrate Heisenberg's Uncertaintity Principle because I'm lazy...
So just know that:
	delta x . delta p will always be greater than or equal to h/4.pi^2
	and some dumb things make it so you can't get perfect measurements the way we have stuff set up right now.

something something entanglement gets explained here and some other stuff but I'm gonig to bed anyways.
