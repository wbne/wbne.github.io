      <h1>Getting Stuff Done</h1>
      <h2>Not the Book</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This is going to be quick because I need to study for my WHAP test >.></p>
      <p id = "steps">First order of buisness, create a checklist, just so that you know what you have and want to accomplish.</p>
      <p>Set two, figure out which ones are the ones you wish to accomplish the most whether it be for economic or just time reasons</p>
      <p>Third, Dedicate some time on a not busy day to just get started, because that's usually the hardest part/</p>
      <p>It's important to note that you fill not finish most of them. After all, no one is perfect. But the important part is that you are able to get back on track.</p>
      <p>The above message doesn't apply if you're just a crazy person who can accomplish everything they want to do...</p>
      <br>
      <p id = "track">Some of you may want to know how to track all of this beyond notepad, well, I think it's really nice to have an application on your phone to keep track of all of your goals.</p>
      <p>Not only can you look at it on the go, but most applications offer a wide range of features that make the app much more powerful than a goals list.</p>
      <p id = "2do">As for applications that are good, I reccomend 2do, it's really useful for organizing projects and managing your school work at the same time.</p>
      <p>Some other huge advantages is that you can also use 2do to have groceries and it can keep nagging you so you don't forget.</p>
      <p>Combining all of this together, along with its clean look and the fact that it's free to try, you can't really go wrong with trying it out.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But the most important part about getting things done is always getting back on track after you have taken a break. I would know because I think I didn't work on this for like 2 weeks...</p>
      <p>So yeah that's my first blog post I think. It's pretty bad because it's late.</p>
