        <p>
            Before I finished my undergrad at UTD I decided to enroll in a grad program so I could work on a second degree while working fulltime at Capital One. 
            However in classic student fashion I missed every deadline except for UIUC’s online Master’s in CS (MCS). With like 2 days to go I turned on my thinking cap and got in with just my transcript and the mandatory Cover Letter. No GRE or Letter of Recs required. 
            To minimize my suffering I hopped online and with some resources like https://uiucmcs.org/ and general web browsing I plotted out the courses I’d take and which semester I’d take them in.
            Now that I'm on the other end of that planned schedule I've decided to give my quick review along with the semesters I took the said classes below:

                            <li>100% worth taking even though it’s considered one of the toughest classes in the program</li>
                            <li>A fun fact is that this was the only class where I read the textbook chapters and grinded out practice problems - just to get a B+</li>

        <h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly I don’t really miss the weekends spent on some projects and assignments but getting my company to pay a good chunk of the tuition definitely helped a lot. 
            If you're interested in learning more about the program from an anecdotal perspective then feel free to reach out!
            As for what I’m going to spend my weekends on, I’m not really sure. I have a few ideas and hobbies I’d like to work on but as for now I will be enjoying my well earned holiday break.
        </p>

        <p>Stay frosty (or sweaty if you’re in Texas) and see you next time!</p>
