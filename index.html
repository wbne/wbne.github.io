      <p id = "aboutMe">Some people may ask "Why should I go to this website?"</p>
      <p>Well, because I am a student, so I can relate to you people</p>
      <p>Also, I have a blog where I complain/give advice or something.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If I have the time, I might also add other topics and other stuff too.</p>
      <p>As of 10/25 at 7:25 AM, I really like this chocolate chip cookie.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Also, I really like using Cherry MX Blues when coding and playing games.</p>
      <p>Once I have anything actually cool to show on the internet, I'll just put it here shamelessly.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Firefox just updated to their Quantum Model. It looks super cool and I highly reccomend using it because you'll feel much cooler than my typing skills...</p>
      <p>But seriously, it's super cool.</p>
      <p>Also I'm not using vue.js because I'm not good enough at it but it might pop up in other stuff.</p>
